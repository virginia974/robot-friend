# robot-friend

CSS Challenge for the Udemy course 'The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery'.

The challenge was to assemble the robot using CSS. The robot moves his head and his right leg when you hover over them. 
It has been improved so that he moves his left leg and arms too. Also, the robot appears and almost disappears gradually.
